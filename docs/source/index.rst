Welcome to the SpinLab documentation. SpinLab is an object-oriented |OpenSource| Python-based package for importing, processing, and analyzing data determined in an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), or Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) experiment. The aim of the project is to provide a free, turn-key python-based processing package for Magnetic Resonance (MR) data.

Features
--------

* Import many different NMR and EPR data formats (Topspin, VnmrJ, Prospa, Xepr, ESR5000...)
* Create N-dimensional data objects
* Easy data processing (e.g. apodization, zero-filling, Fourier transformations, alignment, ...)
